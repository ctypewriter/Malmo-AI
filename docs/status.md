## Project Summary
  The goal of our AI is to create a self-learning, pathfinding AI that uses continuous movement to make its way to a target location. It should be able to jump up hills and climb mountains to it's goal if neccessary, but also find quick and efficient paths towards the goal on flat land. The AI uses reinforment learning (q-learning) to gradually learn an optimal policy.
